    Gathering requirements from stakeholders and implementing design changes is a key part of the software design process. We worked through several iterations of a custom barcode generator for a client.

We created this system using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [the Google API Python client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client).

## App Features
